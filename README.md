# Final Project Idea: Savings App
Category: DeFi
#### Workflow
Goal: User can deposit and withdraw funds.
  1. User connects MetaMask wallet
  2. User deposits x amount in an account
  3. User can see account balance, current token price, and length of time balance has been saved
  4. User can withdraw funds
     1. Triggers reset of the length of time balance has been saved

### Advanced Implementation
  5. Reward users for saving with LP tokens or an NFT
  6. User sets min & max threshold
  7. Using price feed data, contract adjusts to maintain account balance
     a. If x < min : swap for stablecoins
        i. Monitor price of x's token to swap back once x > min
     b. If x > max : add max - x to liquidity pool to earn rewards

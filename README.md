# Final Project Idea

Category: Social Media
Inspiration: MySpace

#### Workflow

  1. User connects their MetaMask wallet
  2. User's NFTs are displayed in a gallery on their profile
  3. Users can edit their profile
     1. Add bio info (social media links, ENS, short bio)
     2. Upload profile pic or choose an NFT from their collection
     3. Pin their Top 8 NFTs
  4. Users can add each other as friends
  5. Users can like NFTs in their friends' galleries
  6. Users can make offers or suggest trades with friends

#### Advanced Implementation (Reach Goal)
  7. User's timeline shows friend activity (ex. "Dinah just added Bad Kid #726 from the Bad Kids Alley collection to her gallery.)
  8. NFT ranking stats - leaderboard shows NFT likes total in descending order
  9. Gallery ranking stats - leaderboard shows gallery likes total in descending order
